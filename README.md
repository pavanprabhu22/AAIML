# AIMusicGenre

A deep learning project that predicts the genre of music using Mel-spectrogram features extracted from audio files.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

This project uses the **Librosa** library to extract features from audio files and trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow/Keras to classify music genres based on their spectrograms.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Audio preprocessing using Librosa
- Mel-spectrogram generation
- Label encoding and data preparation
- CNN architecture for classification
- Model evaluation using accuracy metrics
